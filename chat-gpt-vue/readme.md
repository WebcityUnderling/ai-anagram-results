Okay are you up for a challenge? I'd like to see if we can create the same app in a couple of different frameworks. I will provide you with the Schema again with a few modifications. Good luck, I have faith in your abilities!

Here is a component I would like you to create, the Component name is: Puzzle

Can you create a Vue 3 component with the following information:

Props:
- Prop 1: `letters` - an array of single letter strings.
- Prop 2: `answers` - an array of predefined answers for the puzzle 

Reactive Current Guess: 
- Name: `currentGuess`
- Initial Value: empty string
- Description: a string to be tested against the array of `answers`
- Usage: The property is used to: 
    - Display the current guess
    - Be added to when an item from `letters` is clicked
    - Be set back to an empty string
    - Test it’s value to see it it’s included in the `answers` array

Reactive Found Answers:
- Name: `foundAnswers`
- Initial Value: empty array
- Description: an array of strings that are found in the `answers` array. 
- Usage: the property is used to:
    - Display the a list of found answers
    - Be added to when a new `currentGuess` matches a value in the `answers` array.
    - Only values that are not already found within this property should be added. Like it is a Set

Function: `submitGuess()`
- Purpose: Check if the `currentGuess` is contained in the array of `answers` and if it is contained in the `foundAnswers` array. Perform the following based on the result:
    - If the `currentGuess` is included in the `answers`, and not in the `foundAnswers`, add the `currentGuess` to the `foundAnswers` 
    - After this, clear the `currentGuess`
- Parameters: None
- Return Value: No return value

Function: `cheat()`
- Purpose: Add a random value found in `answers` to the `foundAnswers`. The random value must not already be included in the `foundAnswers`.
- Parameters: none
- Return Value: none

Function: `hint()`
- Purpose: Find a random value in `answers` that isn’t in `foundAnswers`. Once you have a value, can you please split out the first two letters of the value and update the `currentGuess` with those two letters.
- Parameters: None
- Return Value: No return value


Elements to render for Puzzle:
- Current Guess: A paragraph tag displaying the `currentGuess`
- Letter Buttons: An unordered list of buttons, looping over the letters in the `letters` prop. when a letter button is clicked, it appends the letter to the `currentGuess`
- Submit Button: A button that uses the `submitGuess` function when clicked
- Clear Button: A button that clears the `currentGuess` when clicked
- Hint Button: A button that uses the `hint` function when clicked
- Cheat Button: A button that uses the `cheat` function when clicked

For the elements, can you please add suitable class names that follow the BEM methodology to each?

Certainly! I'm up for the challenge. Here's the Vue 3 component named Puzzle based on the provided information:

```
<template>
  <div class="puzzle">
    <p class="puzzle__current-guess">Current Guess: {{ currentGuess }}</p>
  
    <ul class="puzzle__letter-buttons">
      <li v-for="(letter, index) in letters" :key="index">
        <button @click="appendToCurrentGuess(letter)" class="puzzle__letter-button">{{ letter }}</button>
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <button @click="submitGuess" class="puzzle__submit-button">Submit</button>
    <button @click="clearCurrentGuess" class="puzzle__clear-button">Clear</button>
    <button @click="hint" class="puzzle__hint-button">Hint</button>
    <button @click="cheat" class="puzzle__cheat-button">Cheat</button>
  
    <p class="puzzle__found-answers">Found Answers:</p>
    <ul class="puzzle__found-answers-list">
      <li v-for="(answer, index) in foundAnswers" :key="index" class="puzzle__found-answer">{{ answer }}</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'Puzzle',
  props: {
    letters: {
      type: Array,
      required: true
    },
    answers: {
      type: Array,
      required: true
    }
  },
  data() {
    return {
      currentGuess: '',
      foundAnswers: []
    };
  },
  methods: {
    appendToCurrentGuess(letter) {
      this.currentGuess += letter;
    },
    submitGuess() {
      if (this.answers.includes(this.currentGuess) && !this.foundAnswers.includes(this.currentGuess)) {
        this.foundAnswers.push(this.currentGuess);
      }
      this.clearCurrentGuess();
    },
    clearCurrentGuess() {
      this.currentGuess = '';
    },
    cheat() {
      const availableAnswers = this.answers.filter(answer => !this.foundAnswers.includes(answer));
      if (availableAnswers.length > 0) {
        const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * availableAnswers.length);
        const randomAnswer = availableAnswers[randomIndex];
        this.foundAnswers.push(randomAnswer);
      }
    },
    hint() {
      const availableAnswers = this.answers.filter(answer => !this.foundAnswers.includes(answer));
      if (availableAnswers.length > 0) {
        const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * availableAnswers.length);
        const randomAnswer = availableAnswers[randomIndex];
        const firstTwoLetters = randomAnswer.slice(0, 2);
        this.currentGuess = firstTwoLetters;
      }
    }
  }
};
</script>

<style scoped>
.puzzle {
  /* Your component styles here */
}

.puzzle__current-guess {
  /* Styles for Current Guess */
}

.puzzle__letter-buttons {
  /* Styles for Letter Buttons */
}

.puzzle__letter-button {
  /* Styles for each Letter Button */
}

.puzzle__submit-button {
  /* Styles for Submit Button */
}

.puzzle__clear-button {
  /* Styles for Clear Button */
}

.puzzle__hint-button {
  /* Styles for Hint Button */
}

.puzzle__cheat-button {
  /* Styles for Cheat Button */
}

.puzzle__found-answers {
  /* Styles for Found Answers */
}

.puzzle__found-answers-list {
  /* Styles for Found Answers List */
}

.puzzle__found-answer {
  /* Styles for each Found Answer */
}
</style>
```

In the above code, the Vue 3 component Puzzle includes the props letters and answers. It has the reactive properties currentGuess and foundAnswers. The component also includes the methods appendToCurrentGuess, submitGuess, clearCurrentGuess, cheat, and hint to handle the desired functionality.

The elements to render are styled using class names that follow the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology, as requested.

Please note that you'll need to set up a Vue 3 project and incorporate this component into your application for it to work properly. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your experimentation!

Okay, one last thing before I leave you to your devices.  Could you help me write some styles for the page? What kind of information would you like me to provide to help you do that? 
___

Certainly! To help me write the styles for the page, please provide the following information:

1. Overall layout and structure: Are there any specific layout requirements or structure for the page? For example, do you have a header, footer, or sidebar? How should the Puzzle component be positioned on the page?

2. Color scheme: Do you have any preferred colors or a specific color scheme in mind for the page? Providing the primary and secondary colors, as well as any accent colors, will be helpful.

3. Typography: Do you have any specific font choices or typography preferences for the page? If you have any preferred fonts or font styles (e.g., serif, sans-serif), please let me know.

4. Responsive design: Should the page be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes? If so, do you have any specific requirements for how the components should be displayed on different devices?

5. Any additional design elements: Do you have any specific design elements in mind, such as background patterns, borders, shadows, or animations?

Providing this information will give me a better understanding of your design preferences, and I can then proceed to write the appropriate styles for the page.

Okay here you go. Could you style the above component with the following:

1. Overall layout: The page just displays the one component, so I would like it to appear in the middle of the page. The content shouldn’t extend too wide either, as it is only a small component. I would describe each of the elements as the following:- Current Guess: Aligned to the left, large font size- Letter buttons: big chunky buttons displayed in a row, with a tiny gap between each. Bold letters in each button- Action Buttons (submitGues, Clear, Hint, Cheat): big chunky buttons in a row, tiny gap between each. A medium margin on top of each to help distinguish from the letter buttons- Found Answers Heading: Bold and centred- List of found answers:  the container should be a three-row grid, each answer can be displayed in the middle of the cell.
2. Color scheme: I want it to be bright and colourful so people of all ages will find it fun to look at. Can you choose an appropriate colour for the background of each action button, to communicate its purpose a little better? For the rest of the colours, just make sure that the text is legible.
3. Typography: sans-serif is fine. If you would like to install a google font that you think fits the bill so far, go for it! If not, just use the default font
4. Responsive design: When on mobile, display the list of found answers in a two-row grid instead of a three-row grid
5. Additional design elements: Can you add some noticeable hover and focus state on the action buttons?
