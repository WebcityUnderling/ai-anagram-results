# Anagram AI Challenge Results

Please note that these files will not run, this repo is only for analysing the different results of each AI's solution to my presented problem.

## Copilot and CodeWhisperer

End results for each can be found in their respective folders (`result.js`), along with a boilerplate of the original context it was given (`boilerplate.js`)

bring up the boilerplate next to the results to see how the AI interpreted each prompt.

I am aware my code could be a lot more streamlined and verbose, but I wanted to see how the AI would understand the context of the file. 

## ChatGPT

I asked ChatGPT to write the program from scratch for me with the prompts I gave it. The `raw-result.js` contains the results spat out by ChatGPT. The `result.js` has a couple of extra functions thrown in to see how ChatGPT could handle additional context.

A transcript of the converstion I had with ChatGPT can be found in `/chat-gpt/readme.md`

If you want to experiment, I suggest taking the same transcript and seeing if you can get ChatGPT to come up with the same or similar response. if so that's cool, because it means the language model is creating a deterministic solution.

## ChatGPT Vue??

Yes. Because Psuedocode prompting focusses on programming priciples, and not syntax, you can ask ChatGPT to write your code in another framework, or even language.
Chat GPT produced a vue compnent, so I had to setup `App.js` from scratch with all the data the component needed.

I also tried to get ChatCPT to write some css. It didn't do great. But I'll include it in the transcript.
