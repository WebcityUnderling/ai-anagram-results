Hi ChatGPT, I'd like to see if you can help me write a small Next.js App, do you think you we can collaborate to make something cool? 
___
Of course! I'd be happy to help you with your Next.js app. Next.js is a great framework for building server-rendered React applications. Please let me know what specific features or functionality you have in mind for your app, and we can start working on it together.
___
Cool, its is going to be a one page app. and I have Next installed. 
If I were to ask you to write the code based on my instructions, how would you best prefer I do that?

Say I were write you a list of functions to be uses, and the elements to render; what is the best way to do that? 
___
Writing a list of functions and elements to render is a great way to start! You can provide me with the instructions in a step-by-step manner, describing each function's purpose and the elements you want to render. Here's an example structure you can use:

Function 1: fetchData()

Purpose: Fetch data from an API or a local source.
Parameters: None.
Return Value: Promise containing the fetched data.
Function 2: processData(data)

Purpose: Process the fetched data and prepare it for rendering.
Parameters: data - The fetched data from fetchData().
Return Value: Processed data ready for rendering.
Function 3: renderData(data)

Purpose: Render the processed data onto the page.
Parameters: data - The processed data from processData().
Elements to Render:

Element 1: Header with a title.
Element 2: Loading indicator.
Element 3: Error message (if applicable).
Element 4: Displayed data (rendered by renderData()).
Feel free to modify or expand upon this structure based on your app's specific requirements. Once you provide me with the necessary details, I can start writing the code for your Next.js app.
___

Great, to start with I will explain what I want the App to do overall to give you some more context:

I want to create an anagram game, where you are presented with a bunch of letters, and you have to pick different combinations to find words that are in a predefined list
___

That sounds like a fun game! Let's break down the steps involved in creating the anagram game using Next.js. Here's an outline of the functions and elements we can start with:

*ChatGPT gave me an example of how you would lay out a bunch of information. it made up some functions it thought I might need. Needless to say I didn't need them, so I am deleting them from the transcript for brevity's sake*

These are the initial functions and elements we can start with to build the anagram game. Once you confirm this structure, I can proceed with writing the code for your Next.js app.
___

My App also needs some props to be passed, how would you like me to present those to you? 
___

If your app requires props to be passed to components or functions, you can provide me with the details of those props in a structured format. Here's an example format you can use:

Props for Component 1:

Prop 1: propName1 - Description of the first prop.
Prop 2: propName2 - Description of the second prop.
Props for Function 1:

Prop 1: propName1 - Description of the first prop.
Prop 2: propName2 - Description of the second prop.
By listing the props along with their descriptions, you can provide a clear understanding of the data that needs to be passed. Feel free to modify this format or provide additional details if needed. Once you provide me with the prop details, I can incorporate them into the code while writing the Next.js app.
___

I also need to create some reactive properties. how would you like me to supply those? 
___

To define reactive properties in your Next.js app, you can provide me with the details of those properties using a structured format. Here's an example format you can follow:

Reactive Property 1:

Name: propertyName1
Initial Value: The initial value of the property.
Description: Description of the purpose or behavior of the property.
Usage: How and where the property will be used in the app.
Reactive Property 2:

Name: propertyName2
Initial Value: The initial value of the property.
Description: Description of the purpose or behavior of the property.
Usage: How and where the property will be used in the app.
By providing these details, you can clearly specify the reactive properties required in your app, their initial values, and their intended purpose. This information will help me understand how to incorporate the reactive behavior into the code. Feel free to adapt this format or include any additional details specific to your app's requirements.

___
Can you create a Next.js component with the following, the component name is: Puzzle.

Props for Puzzle:
- Prop 1: `letters` - an array of single letter strings.
- Prop 2: `answers` - an array of predefined answers for the puzzle 

Reactive Current Guess: 
- Name: `currentGuess`
- Initial Value: empty string
- Description: a string to be tested against the array of `answers`
- Usage: The property is used to: 
    - Display the current guess
    - Be added to when an item from `letters` is clicked
    - Be set back to an empty string
    - Test it’s value to see it it’s included in the `answers` array

Reactive Found Answers:
- Name: `foundAnswers`
- Initial Value: empty array
- Description: an array of strings that are found in the `answers` array. 
- Usage: the property is used to:
    - Display the a list of found answers
    - Be added to when a new `currentGuess` matches a value in the `answers` array.
    - Only values that are not already found within this property should be added. Like it is a Set

Function: `submitGuess()`
- Purpose: Check if the `currentGuess` is contained in the array of `answers` and if it is contained in the `foundAnswers` array. Perform the following based on the result:
    - If the `currentGuess` is included in the `answers`, and not in the `foundAnswers`, add the `currentGuess` to the `foundAnswers` 
    - After this, clear the `currentGuess`
- Parameters: None
- Return Value: No return value

Elements to render for Puzzle:
- Current Guess: A paragraph tag displaying the `currentGuess`
- Letter Buttons: An unordered list of buttons, looping over the letters in the `letters` prop. when a letter button is clicked, it appends the letter to the `currentGuess`
- Submit Button: A button that uses the `submitGuess` function when clicked
- Clear Button: A button that clears the `currentGuess` when clicked
___

Certainly! I'll create the Puzzle component in Next.js based on the provided requirements. Here's the code for the Puzzle component:

```
import { useState } from 'react';

const Puzzle = ({ letters, answers }) => {
  const [currentGuess, setCurrentGuess] = useState('');
  const [foundAnswers, setFoundAnswers] = useState([]);

  const submitGuess = () => {
    if (answers.includes(currentGuess) && !foundAnswers.includes(currentGuess)) {
      setFoundAnswers(prevFoundAnswers => [...prevFoundAnswers, currentGuess]);
    }
    setCurrentGuess('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Guess: {currentGuess}</p>
      
      <ul>
        {letters.map((letter, index) => (
          <li key={index}>
            <button onClick={() => setCurrentGuess(prevGuess => prevGuess + letter)}>
              {letter}
            </button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      
      <button onClick={submitGuess}>Submit</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCurrentGuess('')}>Clear</button>
      
      <p>Found Answers:</p>
      <ul>
        {foundAnswers.map((answer, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{answer}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Puzzle;
```
You can use this Puzzle component in your Next.js app by importing and rendering it where needed. Make sure to pass the required props letters and answers to the component.

Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance with your Next.js app!
___

I would love to do some more experimentation with the here, just to see how we can work together in future, if that's alright by you? 
___

Absolutely! I'm more than happy to continue experimenting and working together on your Next.js app. Feel free to provide any additional instructions, ideas, or features you'd like to explore. We can continue building upon the existing code or venture into new functionality.

I'm here to assist you in making your app even more amazing, so let me know what specific areas you'd like to focus on or if you have any particular concepts you'd like to explore. Just provide me with the details, and we can continue our collaborative journey.
___

Cheers, can you please add a new function to  our game, you can just write out the function, I will wire it up the way I want it to work in the component. Here is the Schema:

Function: `cheat()`
- Purpose: Add a random value found in `answers` to the `foundAnswers`. The random value must not already be included in the `foundAnswers`.
- Parameters: none
- Return Value: none
___

Certainly! Here's the function cheat() based on the provided schema:

```
const cheat = () => {
  const availableAnswers = answers.filter(answer => !foundAnswers.includes(answer));

  if (availableAnswers.length > 0) {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * availableAnswers.length);
    const randomAnswer = availableAnswers[randomIndex];
    setFoundAnswers(prevFoundAnswers => [...prevFoundAnswers, randomAnswer]);
  }
};

```

The cheat() function adds a random value from the answers array to the foundAnswers array. It ensures that the random value is not already included in the foundAnswers array. If there are no more available answers to add, the function does nothing.

You can wire up this function in your Puzzle component and incorporate it into the desired functionality. Let me know if you need any further assistance or have any questions!
___

Can you please write me one more new function, and then I think I am happy with the scope of the app. It might be a bit tricky so please take your time. Here is the Schema:

Function: `hint()`
- Purpose: clear the `currentGuess`, and find a random value in `answers` that isn’t in `foundAnswers`. Once you have a value, can you please split out the first two letters of the value and update the `currentGuess` with those two letters.
- Parameters: None
- Return Value: No return value
___

Certainly! Here's the hint() function based on the provided schema:

```
const hint = () => {
  const availableAnswers = answers.filter(answer => !foundAnswers.includes(answer));

  if (availableAnswers.length > 0) {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * availableAnswers.length);
    const randomAnswer = availableAnswers[randomIndex];
    const firstTwoLetters = randomAnswer.slice(0, 2);
    setCurrentGuess(firstTwoLetters);
  }

  setCurrentGuess('');
};
```

The hint() function provides a hint to the player by updating the currentGuess. It clears the existing currentGuess and finds a random value from the answers array that isn't already included in the foundAnswers array. It then extracts the first two letters from the random value and updates the currentGuess with those two letters. Finally, it sets the currentGuess to an empty string.

You can integrate this hint() function into your Puzzle component and handle its functionality as desired. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!
